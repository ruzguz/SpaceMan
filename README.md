# SpaceMan

Space man is a  **2D jumping game**.

In order to create this game I finished the “curso de C# para videojuegos” (C# for video games course) and developed all game mechanics from scratch from player movement, Enemies, Level generation and more by using  **C# Scripting** and  **Unity3d**.
